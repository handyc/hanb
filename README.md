# hanb

* hanb is a simple language for creating model universes at any scale  
* hanb can be used with or without a computer  
* if you know the alphabet then you can use hanb  

# board

the basis of the hanb system is a 61-cell hexagonal board  
(displayed in text mode in 2 different rotations):

``         a   a   a   a   a         ``

``                     a                     ``  

each cell contains a single character from a set of 64 total characters:

a-z, A-Z, 0-9, - and .

boards can be written in a compressed form as 61-character strings, e.g.:

``tFZ2fD1LbWJYCkaB-feYB7wkEVjINP.-taGiY8iAef7R1noBhM-uz.Bdwgmld``  

``lmXDMBOHISwvumSev7rZtf449JmaUfPIN0EGWHK-yu782UobkdRNNhrkkDVTS``

Each board represents a finite space at a particular scale between 0 and 63,
also represented by the above character set, such that 'a' is a board filled
with quantum foam and '.' is a board containing a universe


therefore we call 'a' a quantum foam particle and '.' a universe

Multiple universes can be transmitted as a universe matrix #:

example universe matrix containing two universes:

hanb board sizes increase by a factor of 10 with each character, e.g.

1x10^-10 meters or 1 Angstrom is represented by A  

1x10^-9 meters or 1 nanometer is represented by B  

...  

1x10^-6 meters or 1 micrometer is represented by E

...

1x10^-3 meters or 1 millimeter is represented by H  

1x10^-2 meters or 1 centimeter is represented by I  

...  

1x10^0 meters or 1 meter is represented by K  

and so on up to the maximum size of '.' (1 Rm = 1 x 10^27 m, size of universe) 

hanb is based on our actual universe but is highly simplified to allow for different kinds of
relationships to be tested at different scales without requiring a large amount of storage space

hanb can be used for a variety of modeling applications, including computer games,
social relationship simulations, terrain visualizations and other types of projects requiring
large dynamic spaces in limited memory

# coordinates in hanb  

each hanb board has 61 physical cells and a return value of three characters:
we can reference any of these 64 cells using the hanb character alphabet:

``abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789-.``  

therefore we call cell 0 'a', cell 1 'b', etc.
with the return value coded as '9-.'

therefore in the above board we could reference a cell
through its related character
 
there are 64 levels in hanb, which means a total of
64^61 cells or with 3-character returns included, 64^64 combinations.

Every object can be referenced easily through the unique route to its
specific board, with the string length increasing at each level
of resolution. So the position of a universe within its
corresponding matrix # is a single character representing its position
on the matrix board.

e.g. a universe in position N of a universe matrix is addressed
simply as the string:
``N``  

consider a possible universe in which there is a planet 'R' located
somewhere in a galaxy of size 6:

6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 ->Z -> Y -> X -> W -> V -> U -> T -> S -> R

in order to reference its location in the galaxy of size 6 we provide
the cell for its location on that size 6 board:
``K``

``6543210ZYXWVUTS``  
``|||||||||||||||``  
``K``  

then we also provide its position within the size 5 cell returned by the ``K``

``6543210ZYXWVUTS``  
``|||||||||||||||``  
``Ku``  

and on until we get to its position in S

``6543210ZYXWVUTS``  
``|||||||||||||||``  
``Ku3923sderfdewW``  

a complete location of any object within a matrix will be a length inversely
proportional to its size:

. -> - -> 9 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 ->Z -> Y -> X -> W -> V -> U -> T -> S -> R

``.-9876543210ZYXWVUTS``  
``||||||||||||||||||||``  
``aaaaaKu3923sderfdewW``  

Notice that the location string goes only to the length of the board size and not object size,
as we are referencing the object's position within its board.
Above, we reference the location of an object of size R (planet size) within the hierarchy of
boards above it, all the way to the scale of the universe's position within its universe matrix.

The smallest possible 'a' objects (quantum foam particles) are located
in strings 64 characters long, listing universe cell, supercluster ...
all the way to the position within 'b':

Size 'a' quantum particles can not be used as containers, and return a random 3-character string when queried.
and conversely,
Size '#' matrix does not exist in space and therefore does not have a position on a larger board.
The matrix board is the basis for creating space, and contains one or more universes and any other smaller particles.

Consider the following objects with their locations:

Universe:

``object container:  #``  
``                   |``  
``     object size:  .``

# situations and events

The basis for movement in hanb is the relationship between situations and events.
A situation is a hanb board that is described in terms of object positions and object types (use one 64-character string for position as above
and a second 64-character string to define object types):

`bdhdjsskjhbsdgyuulskjhddfsghdjjjhgfdhjgkjskjhgdgdhjdkjhgshgdhPPP`
`ddfgljhgelrufhfhfhuurlkjhffhdjklkjheghjdkjhgdf7876dljhfffjjdg111`

An event is the transition from one situation to a different situation in terms of position and/or type, e.g.

`bdhdjsskjhbsdgyuulskjhddfsghdjjjhgfdhjgkjskjhgdgdhjdkjhgshgdhPPP`
`ddfgljhgelrufhfhfhuurlkjhffhdjklkjheghjdkjhgdf7876dljhfffjjdg111`

--->

`HdhdjsskjhbsdgyuulskjhddfsghdjjjhgfdhjgkjskjhgdgdhjdkjhgshgdhPPP`
`ddfgljhgelrufhfhfhuurlkjhffhdjklkjheghjdkjhgdf7876dljhfffjjdg111`

In the above example, the position string has been altered by one character, such that cell 0 has changed from
object size 'b' to object size 'H'



# time in hanb

The transition from one situation to another, called an event, occurs within a duration of time.
As with space, time is represented as a series of scales using the hanb 64-character set:

abcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Here, a time duration of 'a' is considered as "ambiguous time" and the unit 'b' is called
a Planck time particle equivalent to the amount of time taken for light to traverse one Planck length (spatial unit 'b').
( 1 x 10^-43 s, real world Planck time = 5.391247×10−44 s)

(this duration map is currently underdoing major revisions, so there are some conflicting labels):

`a` -- ambiguous time particle  -- (1 x 10^-44 s is below real world Planck time of 5.391247(60)×10−44 s)

# genetic hanb

# storage benefits  

one board is 61 cells x 1 byte / cell = 61 bytes  
exponent of level of resolution

board size L at resolution  
0: 61^0 = 1 byte (component of larger board M)  
1: 61^1 = 61 bytes (L with K details)  
2: 61^2 = 3721 bytes (L with J details)  
3: 61^3 = 226981 bytes (L with I details)  
4: 61^4 = 13.8 MB (L with H details)  
5: 61^5 = 845 MB (L with G details, pixel level detail)  

hanb translation palettes save memory:  

L -> KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK  
K -> JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ  
J -> IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII  

hanb
translation palette 0 (M cell -> 61 L cells) -- 3904 bytes (61 cell maps for each of 64 possible characters)  

translation palette 1 (L cell -> 61 K cells) -- 3904 bytes   
translation palette 2 (K cell -> 61 J cells) -- 3904 bytes   
translation palette 3 (J cell -> 61 I cells) -- 3904 bytes   
translation palette 4 (I cell -> 61 H cells) -- 3904 bytes   
translation palette 5 (H cell -> 61 G cells) -- 3904 bytes     

3904 x 5 = 19520 bytes    

# 64-character strings

using 64 bytes for each cell (reserve 3 additional bytes for RGB color information):  
64^2 = 4096    
4096 x 5 = 20480 bytes   

A 3-character return value is appended to each 61-character string to allow for a base case
in situations that do not allow a board to be resolved fully:

`AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA555`

In the above example, the string of A characters represents the cell values, and the string "555" at the end is a return value.
In this way an RGB color value or other types on information can be returned with each board as an alternative to displaying the board.
