# hanb

hanb is a simple language for creating model universes at any scale

hanb can be used with or without a computer

if you know the alphabet then you can use hanb

the basis of the hanb system is a 61-cell hexagonal board:

``▗▗▗▗▗▗▗▗A.A.A.A.A.▗▗▗▗▗▗▗▗``  
``▗▗▗▗▗▗▗A.A.A.A.A.A.▗▗▗▗▗▗▗``  
``▗▗▗▗▗▗A.A.A.A.A.A.A.▗▗▗▗▗▗``  
``▗▗▗▗▗A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.▗▗▗▗``  
``▗▗▗▗A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.▗▗▗▗``  
``▗▗▗▗▗A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.▗▗▗▗▗``  
``▗▗▗▗▗▗A.A.A.A.A.A.A.▗▗▗▗▗▗``  
``▗▗▗▗▗▗▗A.A.A.A.A.A.▗▗▗▗▗▗▗``  
``▗▗▗▗▗▗▗▗A.A.A.A.A.▗▗▗▗▗▗▗▗``  

each cell contains a single character from a set of 64 total characters:

a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ and .

boards can be written in a compressed form as 61-character strings, e.g.:

tFZ2fD1LbWJYCkaB_feYB7wkEVjINP._taGiY8iAef7R1noBhM_uz.Bdwgmld

Each board represents a finite space at a particular scale between 0 and 63,
also represented by the above character set, such that 'a' is a board filled
with quantum foam and '.' is a board containing one or more universes

therefore we call 'a' a quantum foam container or a quantum foam particle
and '.' a universe container or universe

hanb board sizes increase by a factor of 10 with each character, e.g.

1x10^-10 meters or 1 Angstrom is represented by A
...
1x10^-4 meters or 1 micrometer is represented by G
1x10^-3 meters or 1 millimeter is represented by H
1x10^-2 meters or 1 centimeter is represented by I
...
1x10^0 meters or 1 meter is represented by K
and so on up to the maximum size of '.'

hanb is based on our actual universe but is highly simplified to allow for different kinds of
relationships to be tested at different scales without requiring a large amount of storage space

hanb can be used for a variety of modeling applications, including computer games,
social relationship simulations, terrain visualizations and other types of projects requiring
large dynamic spaces in limited memory
